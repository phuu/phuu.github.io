I'm available for short- and medium-term contracts, providing help with technical leadership, product engineering, software architecture, product-security design, product management, and engineering process change.

I've been building user-focused software in various guises for nearly 10 years, ranging from hands-on software engieering to engineering management and product management too, both at large, established organisations and small, rapdily growing ones.

I'm most comfortable working at the intersection of product, engineering, design and security, bringing together the best from each of those disciplines to build great products.

You might want me to help you:

- Provide interim technical leadership and direction to a cross-functional product team
- Advise your technical team on architecture in the cloud, scalability, security and operations
- Help bring your product management, engineering, design and other teams together to improve cross-functional collaboration
- Lead a team as a product manager for a short-term project
- Assist with security or data incident response, including hands-on coding or code review
- Provide training on code review, secure coding, scalable architecture, API design or other technical topics
- Grow and improve your hiring, feedback and promotion processes
- Improve internal communication and collaboration
