title: "Product Management Reading List"
---

Over the last couple of years, my work has veered towards product management: either as a close collaborator with one or more product managers, as at Bulb, or in a technical-product-manager-ish role, as at Twitter.

Here are some things that have shaped my thinking about how to manage products:

- [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) — _Website_ — A classic, and worth returning to periodically
- [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook) — _eBook_ — True to form, some great clear thinking from Basecamp
- [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy](http://goodbadstrategy.com/) — _Book_ — Richard Rumelt
- [Radiating intent](https://twitter.com/jmhodges/status/1179536069882048512) — _Twitter_ — Great insight from [Jeff Hodges](https://twitter.com/jmhodges)
- [Autonomy & direction](https://twitter.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1134516731181969410) — _Twitter_ — [Pavel Samsonov](https://twitter.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1134516731181969410)
- [Scope is a lie](https://www.mikeveerman.be/2019/04/20/scope-is-a-lie/) — _Article_ — Mike Veerman
- [Humble Inquiry: The Gentle Art of Asking Instead of Telling](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Humble-Inquiry-Instead-Telling-Leadership/dp/1609949811) — _Book_ — A refreshing tonic to the toxic arrogance inherent in "Radical Candor"
- [The Feedback Fallacy](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy) — _Article_ — "Focusing people on their shortcomings or gaps doesn’t enable learning. It impairs it."
- [NPS Considered Harmful](https://blog.usejournal.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it-fe7a132f4430) — _Article_ — NPS is a widely-used measure of user satisfaction, but it's really not all it's cracked up to be
- [How to receive feedback](https://twitter.com/filipam/status/1143169859393642497) — _Twitter_ — Filipa Moura making really good points about the flip-side of feedback
